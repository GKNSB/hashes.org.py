Python script that downloads all cracked passwords from leaks on hashes.org and merges them into a single wordlist.txt file.
When wordlist.txt already exists, renames it to wordlist-date-of-creation.txt, creates the new one and diffs them resulting in wordlistDiff.txt that contains all the new words between the two files.
Meant to run on linux.
